This repository contains the code and data for the research paper "Bidirectional optimization of firing rate in a mouse neuronal brain-machine interface" published in Biology Letters (2025).
1. GLMM_Data.xlsx: Comprehensive dataset for mixed-effects model analysis.
2. GLMM.r: Complete R script for mixed-effects modeling, including data preprocessing and transformation.
3. Time_to_Reward.xlsx: Average reward latency per trial for each recorded neuron.
4. Mapped_Response.xlsx: Average stimulus-response mapping per trial for each neuron.
5. Control.ino: Arduino-based hardware control code for the experiment (integrated with microcontroller and peristaltic pump).
6. Real_time_algorithm.m: MATLAB script for real-time neural regulation, encompassing signal filtering, firing rate computation, audio frequency modulation, and reward delivery control.
7. Summary_data_table.xlsx: Performance summary of neurons across experimental tasks.
8. Spiking_times_data: Spike timing data for the 13 neurons. Each row represents spike events within a 350ms time window, and each worksheet corresponds to an individual trial.
